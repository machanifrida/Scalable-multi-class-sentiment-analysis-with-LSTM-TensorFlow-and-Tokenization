# Scalable-multi-class-sentiment-analysis-with-LSTM-TensorFlow-and-Tokenization
Built and scaled up a sentiment classifier on 4 million product reviews using TensorFlow

**ðŸ“Œ Project Summary**

This project applies deep learning techniquesâ€”specifically LSTM networks using the TensorFlow frameworkâ€”to build a multi-class sentiment classifier trained on a dataset of 4 million product reviews. Reviews are categorized into three sentiment classes: negative, neutral, and positive. The model is trained in two stages:

On a subset of 500k reviews for rapid experimentation.

On the full dataset using batched processing to ensure memory efficiency during training.

sentiment_subset.ipynb â€” Training on a 500k sample for faster iteration and experimentation.

sentiment_full_batch.ipynb â€” Full-scale training on the complete 4M dataset using data batching.

**ðŸ§  Techniques Used**

- Custom Tokenization with TextVectorization

- LSTM-based neural network

- TensorFlow ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping

- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall

- Data batching to handle large-scale datasets efficiently

**ðŸš€ Model Architecture**

- Input: Tokenized text reviews

- Embedding Layer

- Bidirectional LSTM

- Dense Layers with Dropout

- Output: Softmax with 3 sentiment classes

**ðŸ§ª Results**

Achieved  **84% recall on Negative reviews** and **82% accuracy** on the validation set using 4 M reviews.

Scaled to 4 million reviews with minimal memory overhead via batched processing.
